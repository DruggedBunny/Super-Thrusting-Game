Simple game written in Monkey2 and its mojo3d module:

http://monkeycoder.co.nz/

Thrust-like controls, but in 3D (so super-hard), very work-in-progress.

Randomly-generated levels, using port of PlayfulJS terrain:

http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/

Uses keyboard and, optionally, first Xbox controller detected. (Press A to enable.)

Collect all Space Gems [tm*] to spawn the Atomic Orb [tm*], which appears at your start point, before heading for the Space Portal [tm*]. Refuel by landing on pads.

* Not really.

See TODOs in main superthrust.monkey2 file!
